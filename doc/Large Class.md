# Large Class

When one combines the smell of [Long Method](Long%20Method.md) and
[Long Parameter List](Long%20Parameter%20List.md), but on a higher abstraction
level, then he would get the _Large Class_ code smell. Many long-form methods
and an abundant number of parameters that can be passed to a class cause Large
Class problems. The point is that the class has too many responsibilities and
is doing too much.

## Causation

This problem occurs because, under time constraints, it is much easier to place
a new code in an existing class than to create a whole new class for the
feature.

## Problems

### Hard to Read and Understand

Large components are hard to comprehend, which amplifies if the element is not
purely functional and stateless.

### Hard to Change

It is tough to assess where the change has to be made, and even after it is
done, the developer has to verify whether that was the only one in the class
that had to be changed to implement his new desired functionality. There is
also the risk of breaking the functionalities of all the other responsibilities
that the class has and breaking by making unexpected side effects.

### Hard to Test

The larger the class, the more potential scenarios (all the methods and state
variations) have to be covered via tests.

## Refactoring

- Extract Class
- Extract Subclass
- Extract Interface
- Extract Domain Object
- Replace Data Value with Object
